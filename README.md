# Atrium_VP
This repository contains code for the tool support in following the process ATRIUM, a creation method for the Functional Safety Viewpoint, part of the SMART Architecture Framework designed by Naveen Mohan and others at KTH Mechatronics.

The implementation language is Java, and the tool is modelled using Capella Studio as a viewpoint to be used in Capella.
