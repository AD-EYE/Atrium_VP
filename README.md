# Atrium_VP
<br>

This repository contains code for the _**AD-EYE testbed for Automated Driving and Intelligent Transportation Systems**_, located at KTH Campus Valhallavägen, designed and developed by Naveen Mohan and others. <br><br>


This particular repository contains code for the tool support in following the process ATRIUM, a creation method for the Functional Safety Viewpoint, part of the SMART Architecture Framework designed by Naveen Mohan and others at KTH Mechatronics.

<br> 
The tool is modelled as a viewpoint for Capella, using Capella Studio. The tool is implemented in Java.
